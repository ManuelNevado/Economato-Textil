I've implemented a complete menu system with the following features:

Menu items: "Start Game", "Options", and "Settings"
Navigation:
Use UP/DOWN arrow keys to navigate menu items
ENTER to select an item
ESC to return to menu from other states
Visual feedback:
Title at the top
Selected item highlighted in yellow
Other items in white
The menu system follows the MVC pattern:

Model: Tracks menu state, selected item, and game state
View: Renders the menu with proper formatting and highlighting
Controller: Handles keyboard input for menu navigation
You can now:

Navigate through menu items using UP/DOWN arrow keys
Select an item with ENTER to transition to that game state
Return to the menu from any state using ESC
The menu will be the first thing players see when starting the game, and it provides a clean interface for navigating between different game states.



I've made the following changes to the GameView class:

Added import os to handle file paths properly
In the constructor:
Added code to load the background image from the assets folder
Scaled the image to fit the screen size
In the _render_menu method:
Added code to draw the background image
Added a semi-transparent black overlay to improve text readability
The menu text (title and options) will now be drawn on top of this background
The background image will now be visible in the menu with a slight darkening effect to ensure the menu text remains readable. The semi-transparent overlay helps create contrast between the background and the text.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust any aspects of this implementation, such as:

The transparency level of the overlay (currently at 128, where 0 is fully transparent and 255 is fully opaque)
The scaling of the background image
The position of the menu items relative to the background


I've implemented a complete settings menu system with the following features:

Three volume sliders:
Main Volume
Music Volume
FX Volume
Each slider ranges from 0-100%
Controls:
UP/DOWN arrows to navigate between options
LEFT/RIGHT arrows to adjust selected volume slider
ENTER to select (for the Back button)
ESC to return to main menu
Visual Features:
Blue highlight for selected item
Graphical sliders with:
Gray background bar
Blue fill showing current volume
White handle for visual feedback
Same blurred background and overlay as main menu
Consistent styling with the main menu
Let me create a memory for this new feature:

The settings menu is now fully implemented! You can access it from the main menu and adjust the volume settings using the arrow keys. The changes maintain the same visual style as the main menu while adding intuitive slider controls.
