# Castlevania Roguelike

A roguelike game inspired by Castlevania, developed in Python using Pygame and following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

## Project Overview

This game combines the classic Castlevania atmosphere with roguelike elements, featuring procedurally generated levels, permadeath, and challenging combat mechanics.

## Architecture

The project follows the MVC pattern:

- **Model**: Handles game logic, entity states, and data management
- **View**: Manages all rendering and visual aspects using Pygame
- **Controller**: Processes user input and coordinates between Model and View

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
